To use Nutrition, you can enter individual food items to get back the official name, fat grams, and calories for your search.  We used the 
Nutritionix API on MashApe for this data.  After sequential searches, you can type enter or 'n' to exit at which point you'll be prompted
for your zip code if you'd like a local restaurant recommendation that serves your most frequently searched item from that session.

Your search results are saved to your root directory in a folder labeled 'csv'.  The file is called 'nutrix'.  
We used the Google Geocoding and Google Places APIs for the location data.
